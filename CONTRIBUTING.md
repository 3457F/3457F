# Introduction
Welcome to the repository for team 3457F's **OFFICIAL** robot code! This file aims to be a starting point for anybody (by which I mean *cough* team members *cough*) looking to contribute to our codebase! This document is mainly composed of guidelines on how to contribute, such as how to format issues.

# Some (Hopefully) Common Sense Points...

- if you make a QoL change (Quality of Life change; e.g. a housekeeping change, or a change that makes the code more efficient/readable), and the QoL change impacts code that is _present on multiple branches_, then _propagate these changes across all branches!_

# Issue Formatting
When filing an issue, please make sure to check that...
- you have **assigned** someone to check up on and solve the issue. Usually, [CodeMyGame1](https://github.com/CodeMyGame1) will be one of the assignees, as he is the main coder for the team.
- you have added **labels** to the issue. this ensures that higher priority issues will be attended to first, and it's immediately clear how breaking a change will be, or how difficult it will be to solve an issue
- you have assigned a **project**. For now, just assign it to the 3457F organization's main project (which is also named [3457F](https://github.com/orgs/3457F/projects/2))
- you have added a **milestone**. This helps group related issues and show a broader picture of the progress we're making towards our goals

As for the actual issue content:
- **Title:** Have a clear, concise title that conveys the action that needs to be taken (i.e. "**Add** Custom Autonomous Selector," "**Implement** Automatic PID Tuning, or "**Convert** Autonomous Routines To Pure Pursuit").
  - This helps contributors easily locate the issue they're working on, and get the gist of all the issues on the project dashboard, without having to look through each one individually.
- **Description:** It doesn't really matter much the specific way that you format the issue description. HOWEVER, if there is a specific way you would like the solution implemented, or if there is critical information relevant to the issue that you might forget, don't hesitate to write it down!
